### Use `#-#` for comments instead of `#`

The symbol `#` at the start of a line is a header tag in Markdown and `#-#`
should be used instead for comments. The sintax of the new comment header is
not great but it will avoid mangling markdown.
If you have any script that creates new issues, PRs or comments then they will
need to be updated to new comment header.
